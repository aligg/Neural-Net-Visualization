A side project built with Flask and React that enables users to visualize and better understand a feed-forward neural network. I originally created the neural network portions as part of Eric Reed's software design course at Foothill college.

## Run locally

1. checkout the repo
2. cd into the server directory and run `pip install -r requirements.txt` - you'll most likely want to do this inside a virtual environment
3. run `python server.py` from the server directory to run the server
4. in a new tab, cd into the javascript diretory and run `yarn install`. Then run `yarn watch`.
5. visit http://localhost:3000 in browser to view client side UI

2. add analysis of network performance
3. add
